Chapter 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 are represented in my code.

Chapter 3 - arg parser function

just used the arg parse function to accept the user's path to the file and load the image

Chapter 4 - pixel manipulation/arithmetic, rotation function

used pixel arithmetic to find the center of the image for the basis of rotation

used rotation function to rotate the image 180 degrees

Chapter 7 - histogram creation

used histogram functions to create a 2d color histogram of the three primary colors r,g,b

Chapter 8, 9 - Blurring and Thresholding

used blurring and then thresholding to set up edge detection, but I am not sure on the optimal combination of blurring and thresholding to help with
edge detection

Chapter 10, 11 - edge detection and contours

used edge detection and contours to count the amount of "stars" in Starry Night painting
